# Challenge-1-Jerry-Sparling

## Description

This project I learned about the accessibility standards of websites and how to optimize for search engines. Going into the project there was the problems of no semantic HTML as well as no alterative for the images used. To solve the problems I updated the HTML tags used to follow sematic HTML along with I added alterative descriptions of the photos so it could be optimized for search engines.In doing this project I am able to take what I've learned and apply it to the future websites I will create.
